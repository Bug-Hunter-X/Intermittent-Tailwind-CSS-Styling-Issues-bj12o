# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply consistently. The issue is sporadic and difficult to reproduce predictably.  The `bug.js` file contains an example component exhibiting the unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution, although the root cause remains elusive.  Further investigation is needed to understand the precise circumstances that trigger this behavior.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application (instructions will depend on your setup). 
3. Observe the component in `bug.js`.  The styling may be incorrect, potentially due to unexpected CSS specificity conflicts or other obscure interaction issues with Tailwind's internal mechanisms.  The specific symptoms can change from one instance to another.

## Potential Solutions

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates techniques to mitigate similar issues (e.g., using important flag or more specific class names) but may not be a true solution. The ideal approach is to determine the exact reason why Tailwind doesn't apply the classes consistently and address the underlying problem.
